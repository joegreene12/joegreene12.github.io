<p>Schoolfish is a social network for educational experiences. Built with Sinatra, a wonderfully basic Ruby-based MVC framework, Schoolfish provides the tools needed to find, create, and promote classes and lectures on the web.</p>

<h2 id="the-stack">The stack</h2>

<p>Schoolfish leans on the remarkable simplicity of Sinatra’s approach to MVC. Using server-side rendering via ERB templates, constructing views from Postgresql models is trivial with this platform. While postbacks may be a thing of the past, they are often quite performant, allowing a lean client payload and lower developer overhead to get the job done.</p>

<p>Schoolfish leverages the following libraries to do its humble job:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sinatra for MVC</li>
  <li>Postgresql for managing data</li>
  <li>HTTParty for making server-side HTTP requests in Ruby</li>
  <li>Pony for sending transactional emails over SMTP</li>
</ul>

<p>On the client side, Schoolfish employs the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>jQuery (because duh)</li>
  <li>jQuery UI’s pretty-OK datepicker, and a timepicker addon for simplicity’s sake</li>
  <li>Sass and Autoprefixer for building styles</li>
  <li>Gulp.js for processing Sass into CSS and running Browsersync</li>
</ul>
