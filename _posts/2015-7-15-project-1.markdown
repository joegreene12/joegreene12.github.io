# Schoolfish

Schoolfish is a social network for educational experiences. Built with Sinatra, a wonderfully basic Ruby-based MVC framework, Schoolfish provides the tools needed to find, create, and promote classes and lectures on the web.

## The stack

Schoolfish leans on the remarkable simplicity of Sinatra's approach to MVC. Using server-side rendering via ERB templates, constructing views from Postgresql models is trivial with this platform. While postbacks may be a thing of the past, they are often quite performant, allowing a lean client payload and lower developer overhead to get the job done.

Schoolfish leverages the following libraries to do its humble job:

- Sinatra for MVC
- Postgresql for managing data
- HTTParty for making server-side HTTP requests in Ruby
- Pony for sending transactional emails over SMTP

On the client side, Schoolfish employs the following:

- jQuery (because duh)
- jQuery UI's pretty-OK datepicker, and a timepicker addon for simplicity's sake
- Sass and Autoprefixer for building styles
- Gulp.js for processing Sass into CSS and running Browsersync
