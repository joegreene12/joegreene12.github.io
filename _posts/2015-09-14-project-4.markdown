# projectfour

Application for users that want to learn/improve typing skills. The idea for this
application is to assist in learning and keeping engagement high. Redundancy is a huge
issue in determining success or failure when learning something that seems boring. I hope to make an engaging app by keeping
the user is entertained while learning.

##User Stories
* Users who want to learn how to type while making the experience fun.
* Users who have a hard time learning when the material is "dry".
* Users who want to have fun while working on a viable skill.

*As a user, I want to be able to type fast and learn how to type without the process being
boring and non-engaging through solutions that are appealing.

*As a parent of a user, I want the user, my child, to type correctly and keep them productive and  
entertained with replay-ability.

*As a teacher, teaching users how to type can easily become a bore and be a turn off because of the
redundancy. I know I want users to have a certain proficiency at a certain age/grade
level.

##Installation
##Challenges
Some of the challenges presented throughout the project were implementation of features that will need to be included into the next version. This project was clearly a demonstration of being completely clueless about CSS twelve weeks ago. I am confident that self-improvement in all areas of web development will happen. Keep striving to learn, everyday!
