I am a Web Developer. I am a Web Developer. I am a Web Developer.

Entering web development was something I never dreamed or fathomed of doing. I enjoyed helping others through grant
programming and volunteering in at-risk communities. I decided to pursue web development to increase diversity in the tech
industry, contribute solutions to the digital divide, and was just ready for a new challenge.

I was part of a full stack development cohort that I am truly grateful for the experience. I enjoy the process of self improvement which now includes learning new languages and frameworks. I am detail oriented and look forward to problem solving issues that can make a difference. I am excited to see how my journey unfolds with my web development career.
